# Exception handling in Python is a powerful mechanism that allows developers to gracefully manage and respond to errors and unexpected events that occur during program execution. Here's a comprehensive explanation of various concepts related to exception handling in Python:

# Try-Except Block: The try block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception. The except block is used to handle specific exceptions that occur within the try block.

try:
    b = 2 + "c"
    print(b)
except:
    print("There is an Error")
