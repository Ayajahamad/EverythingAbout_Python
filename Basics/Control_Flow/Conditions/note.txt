-----------------------------------EVERYTHING ABOUT CONDITIONS-----------------------------------
In Python, conditions are used to control the flow of a program based on whether certain conditions are true or false. Conditions are typically expressed using conditional statements, which allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on the outcome of the conditions. Here's a detailed explanation of conditions in Python:

### 1. Boolean Values:
Boolean values represent truth values and can be either `True` or `False`. In Python, various operations and functions return boolean values.

### 2. Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare values. They return boolean values (`True` or `False`) based on the comparison. Here are the comparison operators in Python:

- Equal to (`==`)
- Not equal to (`!=`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

### 3. Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They allow you to perform operations on multiple conditions and return a boolean result. The logical operators in Python are:

- Logical AND (`and`)
- Logical OR (`or`)
- Logical NOT (`not`)

### 4. Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements, also known as if statements, are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. They often include the `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` keywords. The basic syntax of an if statement in Python is as follows:

•	if statements
•	if-else statements
•	elif statements
•	Nested if and if-else statements
•	elif ladder

```python
if condition:
    # Block of code to be executed if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Block of code to be executed if another condition is True
else:
    # Block of code to be executed if none of the above conditions are True
```

### 5. Nested Conditional Statements:
You can nest conditional statements inside each other to create more complex logic. This involves placing one conditional statement within another conditional statement.

### 6. Ternary Operator:
Python supports a ternary operator that allows you to write conditional expressions in a compact form. The syntax is:
```python
result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

### 7. Truthiness and Falsiness:
In Python, values other than `False`, `None`, `0`, `0.0`, `""` (empty string), `[]` (empty list), `{}` (empty dictionary), and `()` (empty tuple) are considered truthy. Everything else is considered falsy.

### Examples:

```python
# Example of if statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# Example of nested if statement
y = 15
if y > 10:
    if y < 20:
        print("y is between 10 and 20")

# Example of ternary operator
a = 10
b = 20
max_value = a if a > b else b
print("The maximum value is:", max_value)
```

Understanding conditions and conditional statements is fundamental to writing programs that can make decisions and react accordingly based on different scenarios. They enable you to create dynamic and flexible code that can handle various situations effectively.
